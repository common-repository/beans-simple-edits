A plugin to let you edit three of the most commonly modified areas in any Beans theme: the post-info (byline), the post-meta, and the footer area. 



== Description ==

This plugin creates a new appearance settings page that allows you to modify the post-info (byline), post-meta, and footer area on any Beans theme. 

Using text, shortcodes, and HTML in the textboxes provided in the admin screen, these three commonly modified areas are easily editable, without having to learn PHP or write functions, filters, or mess with hooks. 

The plugin also allows you to easily modify the default split Beans footer, by either choosing to not display either the left or the right footer content areas, or by replacing them with a centralised content area.

All modified and edited content is rendered using the Beans HTML API and includes Beans Dynamic Hooks.

Beans Simple Edits works especially well in Conjunction with the [Beans Simple Shortcodes plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beans-simple-shortcodes/)

This plugin is under active development, please feel free to contribute at the [Beans Simple Edits Github page](https://github.com/JeffCleverley/BeansSimpleEdits).

The Beans logo and Beans name are being used with kind permission from the amazing people behind the Beans Framework.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I installed the plugin, now what? =

Visit the Beans Simple Edits settings page under the Appearances admin menu and make your edits in the provided text areas.

= Does this plugin require the Beans Framework to work =

Yes

If a Beans Framework Child theme is not the active theme, the plugin will not activate.

Even if it did activate it would be useless.

= What happens if I deactivate the Beans Framework =

If you swap themes to a non-Beans framework theme while the plugin is active then it will just harmlessly disable itself.
